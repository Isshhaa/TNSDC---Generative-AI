# Image Denoising using autoencoder
# Overview
The "Image Denoising Using Autoencoders" project aims to develop a robust system for automatically removing noise from digital images. Leveraging the power of autoencoder neural networks, particularly convolutional autoencoders, this project addresses the challenge of enhancing image quality by eliminating noise artifacts. By training the autoencoder model on noisy and clean image pairs, the system learns to effectively denoise images while preserving important visual details.

# Key Features
1. Utilizes Convolutional Autoencoders: The project employs convolutional autoencoder neural networks, which are specifically designed for image processing tasks. These networks excel at capturing spatial dependencies in images, making them ideal for denoising tasks.
2. Training on Noisy-Clean Image Pairs: The model is trained on a dataset consisting of pairs of noisy and clean images. This enables the autoencoder to learn the mapping between noisy inputs and corresponding clean outputs, facilitating accurate denoising.
3. Adaptive Noise Removal: The system adapts to various levels and types of noise present in input images, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface for users to input noisy images and obtain denoised outputs. This interface facilitates easy integration into existing image processing pipelines or applications.
5. Customizable Hyperparameters: Users have the flexibility to fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture to optimize denoising performance according to specific requirements.
